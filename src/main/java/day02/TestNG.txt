TestNG (Test Next Generation) is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit but with more powerful features.

𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐃𝐨 𝐖𝐞 𝐍𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐍𝐆?
- Flexible Annotations: Organize test code efficiently with annotations like @Test, @BeforeMethod, and @AfterMethod.
- Parallel Testing: Run tests in parallel to save time, essential for large projects.
- Data-Driven Testing: Easily test with multiple data sets using the @DataProvider annotation.
- Test Configuration: Customize test execution with configurable suites, groups, and dependencies.
- Reporting: Generate detailed HTML and XML reports for better insights.
Seamless Integration: Works well with build tools like Maven and Gradle, and supports CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing.

1. Add TestNG Dependency:
 - If your Maven Project, add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

 <dependency>
 <groupId>org.testng</groupId>
 <artifactId>testng</artifactId>
 <version>7.8.0</version>
 <scope>test</scope>
 </dependency>

2. Create a Test Class:
 - Write a Selenium test case inside a class and annotate the test method with `@Test`.

3. Run the Test:
 - Right-click on the test class in your IDE and choose `Run As > TestNG Test`.
 - Alternatively, create a TestNG XML file to define your test suite and run it.

TestNG hooks are special annotations that define the order in which test methods, configuration methods, and suites are executed.
These hooks include:

1. @BeforeSuite / @AfterSuite: Executed before/after all tests in the suite.
2. @BeforeTest / @AfterTest: Executed before/after the test tag in the XML file.
3. @BeforeClass / @AfterClass: Executed before/after the first method in the class is invoked.
4. @BeforeMethod / @AfterMethod: Executed before/after each test method in the class.
5. @BeforeGroups / @AfterGroups: Executed before/after specified groups of tests run.
6. @BeforeClass / @AfterClass: Executed once before/after the first/last method in the current class.

These hooks allow you to set up preconditions and perform clean-up activities in your test suite effectively.
